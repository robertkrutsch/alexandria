This is alexandria, the next big thing for knowlege sharing and finding.


TODO : 
- save localy the dataset from cvf script
- parse the new page http://ceur-ws.org/ and save the dataset
- some tools to parse the pdfs and prepare the data for training. We could use the abstract from the paper and the rest of the paper in training, basically the abstract is a sort summary of what is in the paper; we should see some similarity
- do some prior arrt search of methods and see if there is any code or dataset available
